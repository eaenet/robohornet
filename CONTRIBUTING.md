# How to participate in RoboHornet

The goal of this benchmark is to reflect problems that the web development community is experiencing in practice.  The stewardship committee merely channels that feedback into releases of the benchmark.

As a community member, you have a number of ways to help influence RoboHornet.

##Staying up-to-date
New announcements, like new releases to the benchmark, will be be to the robohornet-announce@googlegroups.com mailing list.

## Spurring more involvement

When a friend complains about performance problems in the browser, point them at the code site and encourage them to contribute!

## Voting up issues that are important

The easiest way to participate.  Explore the [list of open issues](https://github.com/robohornet/robohornet/issues?labels=performance&page=1&sort=updated&state=open) and vote on any issues that you feel are important or that you face.  Each issue has an image badge in it that shows the number of votes. Clicking it will take you to a page that allows you to vote up the issue (after authenticating with GitHub). You may only vote once for each issue.

## Arguing your case for importance

If you just want to make a claim of support for an issue being important, a vote is the most effective way.  However, if you want to make a case for your issue being especially important (for example, you represent a site with many users that runs into the problem), feel free to leave a comment on the issue.

The stewardship committee may use your comments to help decide on the final weighting for a new benchmark.

Comments that are without content, or merely express the sentiment of “+1” without more context or examples of felt pain are not helpful and should be avoided.

## Providing benchmarks

Issues that already have proposed benchmarks are more likely to be included in the next update of the benchmark suite.  You can help out by [creating proposed benchmarks](https://github.com/robohornet/robohornet/wiki/Adding-A-Benchmark) to address performance issues.

## Proposing new issues

If you are experiencing an issue that does not appear to be covered by an existing issue in the tracker, you may create a new issue.  Please check carefully before creating a new issue to avoid unnecessary work for the committee.

To add a new issue, create an issue in the issue tracker describing the problem as precisely as you can and providing context. Someone from the stewardship committee will affix the "Performance" label and include the necessary badge and voting link.

## Proposing changes to issues’ statuses

Community members can make formal movements (or seconds) in the comments to change the status of an issue (e.g. from Removed to Up For Consideration).   Note that the committee is more likely to approve the modification or removal of the issue if you provide a compelling case.

## Sending an e-mail to the committee

To prevent spam, the stewardship committee’s mailing list does not allow e-mail from members off of the list, although the archives of the list are public.

E-mail robohornet-discuss@googlegroups.com with suggestions or other comments.

## Providing technical advice

If you represent a browser or have advice about how some benchmarks can be improved to better measure the performance pain point, you might be interested in the [Technical Advisors](https://github.com/robohornet/robohornet/wiki/Technical-Advisors) program.
